-# <YOUR_APP_NAME>
+# opensaas.sh (demo) app
 
-Built with [Wasp](https://wasp-lang.dev), based on [OpenSaas](https://opensaas.sh) template.
+This is a Wasp app based on the OpenSaas template with minimal modifications that make it into a demo app that showcases OpenSaas's abilities.
+
+It is deployed to https://opensaas.sh and serves both as a landing page for Open Saas and as a demo app.
 
 ## Development
 
+### .env files
+`.env.client` file is versioned, but `.env.server` file you have to obtain by running `npm run env:pull`, since it has secrets in it.
+This will generate `.env.server` based on the `.env.vault`.
+We are using https://vault.dotenv.org to power this and have an account/organization up there.
+If you modify .env.server and want to persist the changes (for yourself and for the other team members), do `npm run env:push`.
+
 ### Running locally
  - Make sure you have`.env.client` and `.env.server` files with correct dev values in the root of the project.
  - Run the database with `wasp start db` and leave it running.
  - Run `wasp start` and leave it running.
  - [OPTIONAL]: If needed (first run of after prisma schema change), also run `wasp db migrate-dev`.
 
+## Deployment
+
+This app is deployed to fly.io, Wasp org, via `wasp deploy`.
+
+You can run `npm run deploy` to deploy it via `wasp deploy` with required client side env vars correctly set.
